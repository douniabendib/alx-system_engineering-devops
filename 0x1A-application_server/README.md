An application server and a web server are two different types of servers used in the context of web applications. While there can be some overlap in functionality, they serve distinct purposes in the architecture of a web application.

A web server is responsible for handling HTTP requests from clients (typically web browsers) and returning the appropriate HTTP responses. It primarily focuses on delivering static content, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript files, images, and other media files, to the client. Web servers are designed to efficiently handle high volumes of incoming requests and are often optimized for serving static content quickly.

Examples of popular web servers include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS. These servers are commonly used to host websites, blogs, and other types of static web content. They are lightweight and provide a simple and efficient way to serve files over the internet.

On the other hand, an application server is a more comprehensive and feature-rich server that provides a runtime environment for executing server-side applications. It is specifically designed to handle dynamic content generation and business logic processing. Application servers support the execution of server-side scripts, such as JavaServer Pages (JSP), PHP, ASP.NET, and other languages.

In addition to handling HTTP requests like a web server, an application server also provides various services and functionalities required by web applications, such as database access, security, session management, transaction management, clustering, and load balancing. It acts as an intermediary between the client and the backend systems and facilitates the execution of complex application logic.

Examples of popular application servers include Apache Tomcat, JBoss/WildFly, IBM WebSphere, and Oracle WebLogic. These servers are widely used for hosting enterprise-level web applications and provide a robust and scalable platform for running dynamic web application.
